            "هیأت شعبه در تاریخ بالا تشکیل است پس از قرائت گزارش آقای ق. طیبی عضو ممیز و اوراق پرونده مشاوره نموده چنین رأی می‌دهد:. رأی شعبه دیوان عالی کشور. بر دادنامه فرجام خواسته مالا ایراد وارد است: زیرا: ۱ - ماده ۱۱۳۱ قانون مدنی مقرر می‌دارد خیار فسخ فوری است و اگر طرفی که حق فسخ دارد بعد از اطلاع به علت فسخ، نکاح را فسخ نکند خیار او ساقط می‌شود به شرط این‌که علم به حق و فوریت آن داشته باشد، تشخیص مدتی که برای امکان استفاده از خیار لازم بوده به نظر عرف و عادت است.۲ - برابر گواهی اداره کل پزشکی قانونی استان خراسان رضوی به شماره ۰۰۷۳۱ - ۱ / ۰۲ / ۴ / ۱۳۹۲ مورخ ۲۰ / ۱۲ / ۱۳۹۲ پس از معاینه از خانم م. پ. فرزند ع مرکز مذکور به طور صریح و بدون ابهام اعلام می‌کند (…دستگاه تناسلی خارجی فرم زنانه و طبیعی دارد در معاینه داخلی مدخل باز اما امکان دخول کمی بیشتر از یک‌بند انگشت می‌باشد و بعدازآن مسدود است، طبق گزارش بیمارستانی در تاریخ ۷ / ۸ / ۱۳۹۱ تحت عمل جراحی واژن سازی مصنوعی با استفاده از پیوند قرارگرفته است) تاریخ ازدواج حسب سند نکاحیه ۳ / ۹ / ۱۳۹۱ بوده و تاریخ تقدیم دادخواست فسخ نکاح ۱۶ / ۱۱ / ۱۳۹۲ می‌باشد. حسب مندرجات پرونده و اظهارات زوج این است که نامبرده ظاهرا پس از مشاهده دستگاه تناسلی زوجه آن را به صورت طبیعی دیده که نظریه پزشکی دلیل این امر است وقتی خواست با زنش نزدیکی نماید متوجه گردید امکان نزدیکی اصلا وجود ندارد و بنا به گفته نامبرده زوجه فاقد آلت تناسلی می‌باشد و در این وضعیت زوج مواجه با اشکال اساسی برای تمتع از زوجه قرار می‌گیرد که به علت ملاحظه و حجب و حیا و به اصطلاح عامه آبروداری که مستقیما متوجه زوجه بوده موافقت می‌کند زوجه تحت عمل جراحی قرار بگیرد چون تصور نامبرده این بوده است که با عمل جراحی ساده که غالبا در این مورد پیش می‌آید مشکل قابل رفع می‌باشد و برابر نظریه پزشکی در تاریخ ۷ / ۸ / ۱۳۹۱ زوجه تحت عمل جراحی قرار می‌گیرد پس از انجام عمل زوج امیدوار می‌شود پس ازآن ادامه زندگی مشترک و برقراری ارتباط زناشویی امکان‌پذیر خواهد بود وقتی متوجه نوع عمل واژن سازی مصنوعی با استفاده از پیوند می‌شود باز مدتی صبر می‌کند تا عفونت ناشی از عمل مذکور مرتفع گردد این بار وقتی متوجه می‌شود باوجود عمل واژن سازی مصنوعی امکان نزدیکی وجود ندارد در مقام فسخ نکاح بر می‌آید گواهی پزشکی حکایت دارد با انجام واژن سازی مصنوعی با پیوند مجرای دستگاه تناسلی زوجه بیشتر از یک (بند) انگشت بازنیست یعنی در حقیقت امکان برقراری نزدیکی بین زوجین وجود ندارد با وصف فوق و طی مراحل یادشده امید زوج برای ادامه زندگی به یأس مبدل شد و تنها راه نجات از این وضعیت را فسخ نکاح دانسته است حسب مندرجات پرونده وضعیت اولیه دستگاه تناسلی زوجه و بعد وضعیت حادث در نتیجه عمل، با توجه به موقعیت درمانی کشور فراهم نمودن مقدمات آن و انجام عمل جراحی و طی درمان و رفع عفوت مجرای (تا یک‌بند انگشت) خودبه‌خود و بالاجبار زمان نسبتا زیادی را باید گذراند تا وضعیت به حالت عادی درآید که متأسفانه این نتیجه هم حاصل نشده است از طرفی حسب گواهی پزشکی ارائه‌شده از سوی زوجه، بین زن و شوهر درگیری شدید واقع‌شده و زوج برابر شکایت زوجه به پرداخت دیات متعدد محکوم‌شده است که نتیجه آن نداشتن زمان برای طرح دعوا فسخ نکاح می‌باشد. به صراحت ماده ۱۱۳۱ قانون مدنی آگاهی زوج برای استفاده از حق فسخ نکاح وقتی برای زوج حاصل‌شده که پس از عمل جراحی امید خود را برای ادامه زندگی از دست داده است و با همه تلاش نتوانست مشکل اساسی زوجه را حل نماید. هرچند استفاده از حق فسخ، حسب ماده مذکور فوری است اما در ادامه آن قانونگذار فوریت را مشروط به علم صاحب حق از فوریت دانسته و استفاده از خیار فسخ را به نظر عرف و عادت جامعه واگذار نموده است. به نظر این شعبه با شرح جریان امر و ملاحظات خانوادگی در این مورد فوریت استفاده از حق خیار فسخ بنا بر عرف حاکم در این مورد به موقع اعمال‌شده است و استدلال دادگاه‌ها در این قسمت ناصواب و قابل پذیرش نیست از طرفی وضعیت زوجه که قطعا خود از آن بی‌اطلاع نبوده و با پیگیری امر در مورد اینکه آیا قاعده می‌شود یا خیر و عدم قاعدگی وی به چه علت بوده توجیه قانونی ندارد وضعیت دستگاه تناسلی زوجه و انسداد مجرای خاص و عدم استمتاع زوج از بضع، محکومیت زوج به پرداخت ۱۸۰ عدد سکه بهار آزادی مخالف قانون و عدالت است چه مردی که نتواند از زوجه خود متمتع گردد محکومیت وی به تحویل ۱۸۰ عدد سکه بهار آزادی بر مبنای و هدف طرفین از تشکیل زندگی مشترک چگونه می‌تواند توجیه‌پذیر باشد، اصولا پرداخت تمام مهریه به زوجه هرچند بر اساس سند رسمی ازدواج بر قرار شده ولی با وضعیت زوجه با عدم احراز صحت دستگاه تناسلی وی و سپس استفاده از آن و ظاهرا عدم وجود بکارت خلاف مقررات قانونی و شرعی است در حقیقت ما به ازاء پرداخت مهریه کدام است و در مقابل کدام تمتع؟ اقتضاء امر این بوده است دادگاه محترم تجدیدنظر استان خراسان رضوی با تعیین وقت دادرسی و دعوت اصحاب دعوا در خصوص مدت زندگی مشترک و زمان اقدامات مربوط به درمان تحقیق و بررسی لازم معمول گردد از زوجه در خصوص وضعیت وی و اینکه به هنگام بلوغ آیا نامبرده عادت زنانگی را دیده است یا خیر و درصورتی که زوجه مدعی عادت زنانگی گردد مشارالیها برای بررسی آن به پزشکی قانونی معرفی و پس از استماع اظهارات طرفین و در صورت لزوم تحقیق از کسان و بستگان آنان آنگاه مبادرت به صدور رأی نماید فلذا به استناد بند الف ماده ۴۰۱ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه‌های عمومی و انقلاب در امور مدنی مصوب سال ۱۳۷۹ رأی فرجام خواسته نقض و پرونده برای رسیدگی مجدد به شعبه ۲۲ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان خراسان رضوی ارجاع می‌گردد.. \n",

            "رأی خلاصه جریان پرونده. حسب محتویات پرونده خانم ز. ب. ن. با وکالت آقای م. ک. در تاریخ ۱۳۹۲ / ۱۱ / ۱ دادخواستی را به خواسته صدور حکم طلاق به طرفیت آقای ب. ج. به جهت تخلف از بند دوم شرایط مندرج در نکاحنامه تقدیم دادگاه‌های حقوقی شهرستان اصفهان نموده است که پرونده جهت رسیدگی به شعبه بیست و پنجم دادگاه عمومی حقوقی اصفهان ارجاع گردیده است خواهان در توضیح خواسته خود اعلام نموده است که برابر فتوکپی سند نکاحیه پیوست رابطۀ زوجیت دائمی فی ما بین زوجین موجود است و علیرغم قدمت این پیمان شرعی و قانونی و علیرغم داشتن دو فرزند ذکور کبیر متأسفانه اختلافات عمیقی بین زوجین حکومت دارد و زوج نه‌تنها معاضدتی در تشیید مبانی خانواده ابراز نداشته است بلکه بارها ایشان را مورد ضرب و جرح قرار داده و فرزندان مشترک خود را تهدید به قتل نموده است و حتی یکبار بر روی سینه زوجه قرار گرفته و به هنگام فشردن گلوی همسرش ناچار به استفاده از دندانهای خود گردیده و با گاز گرفتن دست زوج و استمداد از فرزندان، خود را نجات داده است که در این رابطه حتی محکوم به پرداخت دیه نیز گردیده است. خواهان در ادامه اظهارات خود اعلام نموده است که همسرم سوء معاشرت را به حدی رسانده است که حتی با طرح پرونده‌های متعدد کیفری و حقوقی در مراجع مختلف قضائی نسبت به خلع ید از ملک مرتبط به مطب ایشان نیز اقدام نموده و درخصوص اجرت‌المثل آن نیز اقدام به طرح دادخواست نموده است. لذا استدعای تعیین وقت و دعوت از شهود به منظور بیان حق را از دادگاه نموده و مطالب بیشتر درخصوص عسرت و حرج حاکم بر زندگی خود را به جلسات دادرسی و لوایح تقدیمی موکول نموده است. وکیل زوج در پاسخ به اظهارات زوجه طی لایحه‌ای اعلام نمود که مصادیق استفاده از عسر و حرج به منظور اجرای صیغه طلاق در قانون مشخص است و در ما نحن فیه (ادعای زوجه) هیچیک از موارد مندرج در مواد ۱۱۲۹، ۱۰۲۹، ۱۱۱۹ و ماده ۱۱۳۰ محقق نگردیده در نتیجه خواسته دعوی محکوم به رد می‌باشد علاوه بر این زوجه در دادنامه‌ای دیگر محکوم به تمکین از شوهر گردیده و رأی عدم استحقاق نفقه ایشان نیز از هرگونه تجدیدنظرخواهی مصون مانده و به قطعیت رسیده است و پرونده کیفری علیه زوجه نیز به قرار مجرمیت انجامیده است و در رابطه با شهادت شهود نیز با توجه به اینکه آنچه بر آنها گذشته است صرفا در مرعی و منظر چهار نفر بوده لذا شهادت فرزندان مشترک نیز نمی‌تواند در اثبات عسر و حرج زوجه مستمسک قرار گیرد، همچنین مستند به مسلمات دانش حقوقی در صورت تعارض فیما بین شهادت و اماره قضائی دومی مقدم خواهد بود زیرا شهادت موجب ظن به مشهود به است اما اماره قضائی مفید علم است و مسلم است که ظن تاب معارضه با علم را ندارد. حتی اگر شهادت نیز مفید علم تلقی شود علم حاصل از آن علم نوعی است درحالیکه علم حاصل از اماره قضائی علم شخصی است و در تعارض فیمابین علم نوعی با علم شخصی تقدم و رجحان با علم شخصی است لذا آراء قطعی بر علیه زوجه دائر بر سوء معاشرت اماره قضائی محسوب می‌گردد. علاوه بر این زوجه توانسته است با دستاویز قرار دادن رابطه مادر فرزندی و سایر روش‌ها از جمله تأمین برخی آزادیهای ناروا برای فرزندان جوان خود آنها را در مقابل پدر قرار داده و از شهادت آنها استفاده نماید که چنین شهادتی نمی‌تواند واجد ارزش قضائی باشد و فرجام نحن اینکه عسر و حرج ادعائی زوجه فاقد هرگونه دلیل شرعی و حقوقی است و قابل احراز نمی‌باشد برعکس این زوجه است که محل کار خود را به صورت تمام وقت به تهران انتقال داده و دارای سوء معاشرت می‌باشد لذا تقاضای رد دعوی خواهان را از دادگاه محترم دارم. زوج نیز طی لایحه‌ای که در تاریخ ۹۳ / ۱ / ۲۱ تقدیم دادگاه نموده است اظهار داشت: زوجه اینجانب را بارها مورد ضرب و جرح قرار داده و حتی فرزندانم در اثر تحریک و تطمیع مادرشان با بستن راه‌های تنفسی اینجانب تا حد مرگ پیش رفته‌اند، همسرم بیش از ۶ سال است که محل کار خود را به تهران انتقال داده و از این طریق آسیب‌های روحی و روانی فراوانی را بر بنده و خانواده‌ام وارد نموده است حتی هرگونه انتقاد و اظهار نظر و مخالفت با فرزندانم را از بنده سلب نموده است و با بیان کوچکترین اندرز مورد حمله و ضرب و جرح فرزندان رشید و همسرم قرار می‌گیریم حتی تلاش دوستان و نزدیکان و بستگان نزدیک هم در ایجاد سازش بدون نتیجه مانده است، همسرم تلاش می‌کند با جمع‌آوری مدارک واهی و کمک پزشکان آشنا و همکار خود پرونده محجوریت اینجانب را تکمیل و از این طریق کنترل و اختیار اموالم را نیز بدست بگیرد لذا بدلیل این اعمال امنیت جانی و آسایش روانی در منزل از اینجانب سلب گردیده است. دادگاه در وقت مقرر (تاریخ ۹۳ / ۱ / ۲۴) تشکیل جلسه داده و قرار رسیدگی توأمان درخصوص پرونده‌ای با موضوع درخواست زوج نسبت به اجازه ازدواج مجدد و همچنین پرونده دیگر درخصوص طلاق به درخواست زوجه را صادر و اعلام می‌نماید. طرفین به همراه وکلای خود در جلسه رسیدگی حضور دارند دادگاه خطاب به زوج اعلام می‌نماید خواسته خود را بیان نمائید زوج در پاسخ دادگاه اظهار داشت: مدت ۲۶ سال است که ازدواج نموده و دارای دو فرزند ۲۳ و ۲۱ ساله پسر هستیم همسرم علیرغم رأی صادره از اینجانب تمکین نمی‌نماید و بدون هماهنگی با اینجانب محل کار خود را به صورت دائمی به تهران انتقال داده و درآنجا اقامت دارد. لذا تقاضای ازدواج مجدد را از دادگاه دارم. زوجه در پاسخ به اظهارات زوج اعلام نمود به هیچ وجه حاضر به زندگی با همسرم نیستم و درخصوص دعوی اجازه ازدواج ایشان بنده حرفی ندارم و در رابطه با دعوی طلاق باید عرض کنم همسرم بشدت نسبت به اینجانب بد بین است و مرتب توهین و فحاشی می‌نماید چندین بار نیز مرا مورد ضرب و شتم قرار داده است حاضر به پذیرش استقلال مالی اینجانب نمی‌باشد فرزندانم شاهد سوء رفتار و مشکلات روحی پدر خود می‌باشند زیرا او مبتلا به بیماری پارانوئید (اسکیزوفرنی) است لذا تقاضای معرفی ایشان به پزشکی قانونی را جهت اثبات ادعای خود دارم، علاوه بر این ۲۳ سال است که مخارج زندگی را پرداخت نمی‌نماید در نتیجه با بذل یکعدد سکه از مهریه خویش تقاضای طلاق دارم. زوج اظهار داشت بیماری روانی ندارم و حاضر به طلاق نیز نیستم حاضرم به پزشکی قانونی معرفی شوم. همسرم با کمک دو فرزند جوانش مرا مورد ضرب و شتم قرار می‌دهند و حتی قصد خفه کردن اینجانب را داشتند آنها قصد دارند با صدور حکم حجر کنترل اموالم را در دست بگیرند دادگاه در تاریخ ۹۳ / ۱ / ۲۴ بشرح ذیل تصمیم‌گیری نمود: نظر باستناد زوجه به شهادت شهود مقرر می‌گردد وقت رسیدگی تعیین و زوج نیز به پزشکی قانونی معرفی شوند تا ادعای زوجه درخصوص بیماری همسرش بررسی گردد و اینکه آیا حضور زوجه در نزد همسرش بیم و خوف جانی برای زوجه را به دنبال دارد یا خیر؟ شهود (فرزندان مشترک) در تاریخ ۹۴ / ۴ / ۲۳ در دادگاه حاضر و مسأله توهین و تهدید و فحاشی و ایراد ضرب و شتم پدر نسبت به مادر را مورد تأیید قرار دادند شاهد دیگری بنام خانم ط. ن. نیز اظهار داشت چند بار آثار ضرب و شتم ناشی از کتک‌کاری زوج نسبت به همسرش را مشاهده نمودم و حتی یکبار از ترس به منزل ما آمد در همین تاریخ زوج اعلام نموده است به دلیل اینکه پزشکی قانونی ممکن است به خاطر همکار بودن با همسرم با یکدیگر ارتباط داشته باشند از معرفی خود به پزشکی قانونی خودداری خواهد نمود. و حاضر نیست تحت معاینه آن مرکز قرار گیرد. ضمنا اضافه نمود که همسرم مقدار یکصد و پنجاه میلیون تومان طلا و جواهرات را با خود برده است در برابر ادعای زوجه یک برگ از معاینه پزشک اعصاب و روان را تقدیم دادگاه نموده است که ضمن تأیید درجاتی از اضطراب در مجموع به طبیعی بودن رفتار زوج گواهی داده است. دادگاه در تاریخ ۹۴ / ۴ / ۲۳ قرار ارجاع امر به داوری را صادر و اعلام می‌نماید. داور زوجه در نظریه خود اعلام نمود که با توجه به عمق، شدت و جزئیات اختلاف فی‌مابین زوجین هیچ بارقه امیدی برای رفع اختلافات و ادامه این زندگی ناهنجار وجود ندارد و در اثر این اختلافات سلامت آینده خانواده به طور جدی دچار مخاطره خواهد شد اما داور زوج (والده زوج) در نظریه داوری خود تقاضای فرصت زمانی اضافی برای بهبود و اصلاح خانواده را از دادگاه تقاضا نموده و اعلام داشت فرزند ایشان خواستار طلاق نمی‌باشد و خواهان ادامه زندگی مشترک بوده و امکانات آن را نیز فراهم نموده است. دادگاه در تاریخ مقرر (۹۳ / ۶ / ۲۴) تشکیل جلسه داده و ضمن درج خلاصه پرونده و با توجه به اظهارات زوجین و شهادت فرزندان و همچنین امتناع زوج از معرفی خود به پزشکی قانونی و با توجه به عدم مخالفت زوجه درخصوص دعوی زوج مبنی بر ازدواج مجدد مستندا به بند سوم از ماده ۱۶ قانون حمایت خانواده مصوب سال ۱۳۵۳ حکم به اجازه ازدواج مجدد زوج را صادر و اعلام می‌نماید و درخصوص دعوی زوجه به خواسته صدور حکم طلاق نیز با توجه به درگیری بین زوجین و سالها اختلاف فی‌مابین و ایراد ضرب و شتم زوج نسبت به زوجه و عدم قبول زوج جهت معرفی به پزشکی قانونی و اظهارات فرزندان مشترک مستندا به ماده ۱۱۱۹ قانون مدنی و مواد ۲۴ - ۲۶ - ۲۷ و ۲۹ و ۳۳ قانون حمایت خانواده مصوب ۱۳۹۱ حکم بر احراز شرایط اعمال وکالت در طلاق توسط زوجه را صادر و اعلام می‌دارد. زوجه پس از گذشت مهلت مقرر و عدم اعتراض زوج جهت اجرای صیغه طلاق به دفترخانه مراجعه می‌نماید اما زوج به دادگاه مراجعه و با ذکر این نکته که ابلاغ رأی صادره در کلانتری مفقود گردیده و به ایشان ابلاغ نگردیده است که مجددا در تاریخ ۹۳ / ۱۰ / ۱۶ رأی صادره در دفتر شعبه به صورت حضوری به زوج ابلاغ گردیده است (گواهی کلانتری در صفحه ۹۹ پرونده نیز حکایت از مفقود شدن ابلاغ مورد نظر دارد) زوج در فرجه قانونی به رأی صادره از دادگاه بدوی اعتراض نمود و در لایحه تجدیدنظرخواهی خود اظهار داشت: اختلاف اینجانب با همسرم در حدی نیست که عسر و حرج از آن استنباط گردد و این اختلافات صوری است علاوه بر این ۹۰ درصد خانم هائی که طلاق گرفته‌اند متعاقبا پشیمان شده‌اند لذا اینجانب در جلسات مختلف مخالفت خود را با طلاق اعلام نمودم علاوه بر این و صدور ازدواج مجدد برای زوج از یک‌طرف و صدور حکم طلاق برای زوجه از سوی دادگاه با یکدیگر تعارض دارد زیرا در صورت طلاق نیازی به اذن دادگاه جهت ازدواج مجدد نمی‌باشد. ضمنا در ماده ۱۱۳۳ قانون مدنی شرایط استحقاق طلاق توسط زوجه مشخص گردیده است که هیچیک از موارد مذکور در ماده محقق نگردیده است و تنها استناد دادگاه شهادت دو فرزند مشترک می‌باشد که زوجه با مستمسک قرار دادن رابطه مادر فرزندی و سایر روشها از شهادت آنها بر علیه اینجانب استفاده نموده و فرزندانم را در تقابل با من قرار داده است اینجانب دچار بیماری پارانوئید نمی‌باشم و از نظر عقلی و روانی سالم بوده و هیچگاه یک انسان روانی نمی‌تواند در یک سازمان حساس مثل سازمان انرژی هسته‌ای مشغول به کار و موفق نیز باشد لذا طبق ماده ۱۹۹ قانون آئین دادرسی مدنی شهادت شهود را رد نموده و تقاضای نقض دادنامه بدوی را از دادگاه تجدیدنظر دارم. زوجه نیز در لایحه تقدیمی به ابلاغ مجدد رأی صادره از دادگاه بدوی علیرغم پایان یافتن مهلت قانونی اعتراض نموده و تقاضای رفع اثر از ابلاغ بعدی را نموده است، پرونده جهت رسیدگی به اعتراض تجدیدنظرخواه به شعبه ۲۴ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان اصفهان ارجاع می‌گردد. و با توجه به ضرورت اخذ توضیح از طرفین دعوی دادگاه وقت رسیدگی تعیین و مقرر نمود تا زوجین جهت ادای توضیحات به دادگاه دعوت شوند. وکیل زوجه نیز طی لایحه‌ای ضمن تکرار مطالب گذشته اعلام نمود یکبار زوج قصد خفه نمودن موکل اینجانب را داشت که زوجه ناگزیر با گاز گرفتن دست همسرش و نیز کمک فرزندان توانسته خود را نجات دهد که برای این عمل (گاز گرفتن دست) زوجه دیه نیز پرداخت‌نموده است. علاوه بر این جهت ایذاء بیشتر همسر خود نسبت به تخلیه مطب زوجه نیز اقدام نموده است درخصوص بیماری پارانوئید خود نیز حاضر به مراجعه به پزشکی قانونی نیست که همه اینها مؤید ادعاهای موکله اینجانب می‌باشد درخصوص خارج نمودن طلاها از منزل نیز شعبه ۲۸ دادگاه عمومی حقوقی اصفهان حکم به رد دعوی خواهان صادر نموده و ادعای زوج را غیر ثابت تشخیص داده است (ص ۱۲۰ پرونده) دادگاه تجدیدنظر با ذکر این نکته که بیشتر محکومیت‌ها متوجه زوجه می‌باشد و این زوجه است که با شوهر خود سوء معاشرت داشته است و اگر زوج نیز دارای سوء معاشرت می‌بود زوجه با او در یک‌منزل زندگی نمی‌کرد و زندگی در یک‌منزل برای او غیر قابل‌تحمل می‌شد و با توجه به اینکه شهادت فرزندان و دیگران کافی برای اثبات عسر و حرج و تحقق شرط دوم از شرایط مذکور در سند ازدواج نمی‌باشد و از طرفی عدم مراجعه به پزشکی قانونی نیز با لحاظ آنکه در پرونده دلیلی بر رفتارهای غیرمتعارف او ارائه نگردیده است دلیلی بر بیماری پارانوئید و مشکل اعصاب و روان زوج محسوب نمی‌گردد تا بتوان علت عدم مراجعه به پزشکی قانونی زوج را بیماری تلقی نمود لذا تجدیدنظرخواهی را موجه تشخیص داده و مستندا به ماده ۳۵۸ قانون آئین دادرسی مدنی حکم به رد دعوی طلاق خانم ز. ب. را صادر می‌نماید. وکیل زوجه در مرحله فرجامخواهی طی لایحه‌ای اعلام نمود طرح پرونده‌های متعدد کیفری و حقوقی نمایانگر آن است که اختلافات حادث فیمابین زوجین عمیق و کهنه و مزمن و غیرقابل حل و فصل است زوج در جهت تخفیف قدر و منزلت اجتماعی همسر خود که پزشک می‌باشد از هیچ اقدامی خودداری ننموده است زوج از یک‌طرف به عدم تمکین همسرش اشاره می‌نماید و از طرف دیگر می‌گوید که همسرم چگونه در عسر و حرج است که با بنده در زیر یک سقف زندگی می‌نماید. زوجه نیز در لایحه‌ای دیگر مطالبی را مطرح می‌نماید که به نکات مهم آن اشاره و در صورت ضرورت به هنگام شور تمام مطالب آن قرائت خواهد شد: در شرایطی که همسرم (زوج) با تمام قوا تلاش در انتساب کلیه رذایل اخلاقی، صفات نکوهیده و تخلفات عدیده جزائی و کیفری به من و فرزندانم را دارد (مستند به شکایات و لوایح متعدد و مفصل موجود در پرونده‌های مختلف) و با توجه به اینکه پا درمیانی دوستان و همکاران و بستگان نیز ثمری نبخشیده است راهی جز سپردن تعیین سرنوشت آتی زندگی به محاکم قضائی باقی نمانده است، همسری که با دوربین و ابزار ضبط و ویرایش صدا و تصویر در منزلی که محل امن و آسایش است مستقر گردیده و جوشش‌ها و فریادهای اعتراض همسر خود را ضبط و بعنوان مدرک استفاده می‌نماید، همسری که با فحاشی به پدرم که هنوز تن‌پوش آخرتش از آب تغسیل مرطوب است احساسات مرا جریحه‌دار نموده است پدری که در تمام لحظات عمرم الگو و اسطوره زندگی من بوده است، مردی که اینجانب را هر روز به آگاهی و دادگاه و دادسرا کشانده و اتهاماتی همچون سرقت، تهدید به قتل و ضرب و جرح بر اینجانب وارد نموده است آیا کوچکترین نمادی از لطف و مهر و عاطفه و غیرت و مردانگی و تعصب نسبت به خانواده خود دارد، پدری که یکساعت قبل از کنکور کارشناسی ارشد با چاقو فرزند خود را مورد تهدید قرار می‌دهد و شب امتحانات آخر ترم تا ساعت ۵ صبح او را در کلانتری نگه می‌دارد (به دلیل شکایت پدر) پدری که در مراسم عقد فرزند خود حاضر نگردیده و با افتخار و لذت از احساس خفت و خواری خانواده‌اش یاد می‌کند پدری که با ده‌ها مدرک و سند و CD و جعل به طور مستمر با هزاران برگ شکایت علیه همسر و فرزندانش پرونده‌سازی می‌کند آیا عاشق زندگی است تلاشی که باید در جهت آسایش زندگی بکار می‌گرفت را تماما صرف نابودی بنیانهای ارتباطی و فرهنگی خانواده نموده است لذا خانه سالهاست که برای من مفهوم امنیت و آرامش ندارد و در چهار سال اخیر حتی برای فرزندانم نیز این مفهوم از دست رفته است. بدلیل همین فضای ایجاد شده به جبر خود را به تهران انتقال داده‌ام و ۵ سال است که بین تهران و اصفهان در ترددم تا تهدیدی کمتر بر سر فرزندانم آوار باشد. تمام اموالم حتی سهم مشاع مطب محل درآمد و تلفن همراه (غیر از دو دانگ یک آپارتمان و ماشینی با قدمت ده ساله که نسبت به استرداد ماشین هم علیه اینجانب شکایت نموده است) همه و همه به نام ایشان بوده است و اخیرا متوجه شدم که از کارت ملی و شناسنامه من سوء استفاده مالی در شرکت خصوصی خود نموده است. لذا تنها خاطره من از زندگی مشترک بار مشکلات و فشارهای روحی، روانی و ناجوانمردانه و فریب و دروغ و تزویر بوده است و هم‌اکنون منتظر محکمه عدل الهی هستم تا حساب این زندگی را بین ما تسویه نماید. ضمنا حقایقی را نیز از جریان ازدواج مادر ایشان و ماجرای تولد ایشان دریافته‌ام که بر حسب اعتقاداتم ادامه زندگی را با ایشان غیر ممکن نموده است. (در صورت نیاز و صلاحدید عنوان خواهد نمود) لذا در محضر خداوند عالم اعلام می‌دارم که ۱ - از چهار سال پیش تاکنون از ادامه زندگی با ایشان کراهت تمام داشته‌ام ۲ - تحت فشارهای روحی و جسمی بوده و زندگی‌ام مصداق کامل عسر و حرج می‌باشد ۳ - دیگر قادر به تحمل علائم بیماری روحی ایشان نیستم (دلیل این مطلب نیز امتناع ایشان در معرفی خود به پزشکی قانونی می‌باشد). پرونده پس از وصول به دیوانعالی کشور و جری تشریفات لازم جهت رسیدگی به این شعبه ارجاع گردیده است. هیئت شعبه در تاریخ بالا تشکیل گردید. پس از قرائت گزارش آقای حسن حمیدیان عضوممیز و اوراق پرونده درخصوص دادنامه شماره ۰۰۳۸۲ - ۱۳۹۴ / ۳ / ۵ فرجام خواسته مشاوره نموده چنین رأی می‌دهد:. رأی شعبه دیوان عالی کشور. دادنامه فرجامخواسته مآلا دارای خدشه و ایراد است زیرا فرجام‌خواه در دادخواست تقدیمی و جلسات مختلف دادرسی و همچنین لوایح تقدیمی علت درخواست طلاق را سوء معاشرت، ایراد ضرب و جرح عمدی و ایراد اتهامات واهی و طرح متعدد پرونده‌های کیفری و حقوقی توسط زوج عنوان نموده است که دادگاه بدوی با اشاره به برخی از مصادیق مذکور عسر و حرج زوجه را احراز نموده و با توجه به احراز تخلف زوج از بند دوم شروط ضمن العقد حکم بر احراز شرایط اعمال وکالت در طلاق توسط زوجه را صادر و اعلام می‌نماید اما دادگاه تجدیدنظر ضمن رد شهادت شهود و قابل اهمیت ندانستن سرپیچی زوج از عدم معرفی خود به پزشکی قانونی علیرغم دستور قضائی در استدلال خود به این نکته اشاره نموده است که محکومیت‌های زوجه نشان‌دهنده آن است که زوجه دارای سوء معاشرت می‌باشد و حضور زوجه در زیر یک سقف دلیل آن است که زوجه دچار عسر و حرج نمی‌باشد و اگر دچار عسر و حرج می‌بود زندگی در یک‌منزل برای زوجه غیر قابل‌تحمل می‌شد و دیگر با همسرش در یک‌منزل زندگی نمی‌کرد. (علیرغم ذکر این نکته که زوجه حدود ۸ سال است که محل کار خود را به صورت دائمی به تهران انتقال داده و فقط روزهای جمعه به اصفهان می‌آید) لذا تجدیدنظرخواهی زوج را موجه تشخیص داده و حکم به رد دعوی طلاق زوجه را صادر و اعلام می‌نماید. لذا با التفات به این موضوع که در مسأله عسر و حرج نمی‌توان مفهوم ساده‌ای از آن را برداشت نمود زیرا طبق این قاعده و از نظر حقوقی هر چیزی که زندگی را عادتا برای زوجه شاق و سخت و غیرقابل تحمل نماید می‌تواند از مصادیق عسر و حرج محسوب شود، عسر و حرج تابلوی کلینیکی و مصادیق خاص ندارد بلکه افراد آن فراوان است و رفع مشقت جهت اصلی وضع این قاعده می‌باشد و در کلیه مصادیقی که حد و توان زوجه را به طور عرفی نشانه گیرد محقق خواهد شد زیرا مصادیق آن بر محور رفع ضرر و حرج می‌چرخد و شامل هر مصداقی که به نوعی متضمن مشقت برای زوجه باشد را شامل گردیده و از نظر شارع مقدس مردود و مرفوع است و دادگاه‌ها باید به مثابه یک قاعده عام و فراگیر به این قاعده نگریسته و در جهت حل مشکلات زنان و جلوگیری از ضرر بیشتر در خانواده‌ها از آن استفاده نمایند. درگیری مداوم زوجین با یکدیگر، طرح متعدد پرونده‌های کیفری و حقوقی علیه زوجه و فرزندان (حدود ۱۲ جلد پرونده با صدها صفحه)، تهدید فرزندان به قتل و بالعکس تهدید به قتل پدر توسط فرزندان و ادعای اقدام برای خفه نمودن پدر توسط فرزندان مشترک به حمایت از مادر و طرح شکایات کیفری در این رابطه از سوی پدر، ایراد ضرب و شتم، توهین و تحقیر یکدیگر، حاکم و محکوم نمودن تمام اعضاء خانواده در محاکم کیفری و حقوقی، ادعای پدر دائر بر نداشتن امنیت جانی و روانی در منزل بدلیل تهدیدات فرزندان رشید و مشترک، مفارقت جسمانی حدود ۸ ساله و کراهت قطعی چهار ساله زوجه از زوج، انتقال محل دائمی اشتغال زوجه به تهران به دلیل همین اختلافات، گرفتن حکم تخلیه مطب همسر (زوجه) و درخواست اجرت‌المثل از وی، اقدام به استرداد اتومبیلی که حتی به نام زوجه بوده است در محاکم مربوطه، به کلانتری و آگاهی کشاندن همسر و فرزندان آن هم در شب امتحان با تهام تهدید به قتل پدر توسط فرزندان (به دلیل اختلافات زوجین با یکدیگر) عدم حضور پدر در مراسم عقد فرزند به ادعای زوجه و تحقیر خانواده از این طریق، نصب دوربین و ابزار ضبط و تصویر در منزل و ایراد اتهاماتی همچون سرقت، تهدید و توهین علیه یکدیگر و انتساب بسیاری از رذایل اخلاقی و تخلفات عدیده نسبت به زوجه و فرزندان و پرونده‌سازی علیه یکدیگر از مشخصات یک زندگی متعادل نیست و نهایتا بی‌نتیجه ماندن تمام تلاشهای بستگان و نزدیکان و دوستان در ایجاد سازش و تقاضای ازدواج مجدد توسط زوج همه و همه نشان‌دهنده آن است که هیچگونه علاقه‌ای میان زوجین در زندگی مشترک وجود ندارد لذا ضمن توجه دادن دادگاه صادر کننده رأی به منظومه و مجموعه علل و عوامل مذکور و همچنین معرفی زوج به پزشکی قانونی و تحقیقات بیشتر پیرامون مطالب مندرج در لایحه فرجام‌خواهی زوجه، رأی صادره در وضعیت حاضر قابلیت تأیید ندارد و به جهات اشعاری و با استناد به بند ۵ از ماده ۳۷۱ قانون آئین دادرسی دادگاه‌های عمومی و انقلاب در امور مدنی نقض می‌گردد و رسیدگی بعدی به استناد بند الف ماده ۴۰۱ قانون مارالذکر به همان شعبه صادر کننده رأی محول تا با بررسی همه‌جانبه و توجه به متغیر بودن مصادیق عسر و حرج و گسترده دانستن قلمرو این قاعده پر ارج و پر منزلت برای جلوگیری از ضرر بیشتر و تهدیداتی که طبق اظهارات مجموعه خانواده (زوجه، زوج و فرزندان مشترک) خانواده آنها را تهدید جدی می‌نماید رأی مقتضی را صادر فرمایند. \n",

جهت بدهکاری به احدی از مشتریان بانکی از حساب واسطه بانک مبلغ فوق الاشاره را برداشت و به حساب مشتری جهت اداء دین شخصی واریز می\\u200cنماید و علی\\u200cرغم تذکرات مراجع نظارتی نسبت به جبران خسارات وارده

می\\u200cنماید که در صورت ارتکاب بزه مشابه و شمول ماده ۵۴ قانون مجازات اسلامی ۱۳۹۲ مجازات حبس تعیین\\u200cشده اجرا و الا کان لم یکن گردد. رأی صادره حضوری، ظرف بیست روز قابل تجدیدنظرخواهی در محاکم تجدیدنظر استان تهران می\\u200cباشد.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۱۰۶۰ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران ویژه رسیدگی به جرائم کارکنان دولت عالیشاه. رأی دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان. تجدیدنظرخواهی آقای م. نسبت به دادنامه شماره ۹۳۰۹۹۷۰۲۳۰۸۰۰۳۳۳ مورخ ۳۰ / ۰۶ / ۱۳۹۳ صادره از شعبه ۱۰۶۰ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران که به موجب آن متهم تجدیدنظرخواه به اتهام اختلاس مبلغ سیصد میلیون (۳۰۰۰۰۰۰۰۰) ریال، به تحمل یک سال حبس تعزیری و پرداخت جزای نقدی به مبلغ شش\\u200cصد میلیون ریال در حق دولت و انفصال موقت از خدمات دولتی به مدت یک سال محکومیت جزایی حاصل نموده و در اجرای تبصره ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری اجرای مجازات حبس به مدت سه سال معلق و از پرداخت جزای نقدی معاف شده؛ وارد به نظر نمی\\u200cرسد. چه آن\\u200cکه متهم تجدیدنظرخواه آقای م. از زمره کارکنان و مستخدمین موضوع ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری بوده که اموال و وجوه بانک به طور مستقیم و غیرمستقیم بنا بر مقتضای وظیفه اداری\\u200cاش به او سپرده شده که وظیفه حفظ و حراست از اموال و وجوه دولتی را بر عهده داشته و به رغم منع و حذر قانون با سوءاستفاده از مقام و موقعیت شغلی و آن هم با سبق تصمیم و برنامه\\u200cای از پیش طراحی\\u200cشده با توسل به یکسری اعمال به ظاهر قانونی ولی در اصل مغایر با قوانین و مقررات مبلغ سیصد میلیون (۳۰۰۰۰۰۰۰۰) ریال از وجوه متعلق به بانک را از طریق دخل و تصرف در حساب مشتریان بانک برداشت و تصاحب نموده است. اضافه بر این\\u200cکه دراین بین در اختیار شخص اداری قرار گرفتن وجوه مورد اختلاس که ازجمله شرایط تحقق این جرم است به نظر می\\u200cرسد در پرونده امر تحقق\\u200cیافته است. چون آنچه از مفهوم سپرده شدن وجوه نقدی، مطالبات، حوالجات یا سهام و یا سایر اسناد و اوراق بهادار یا سایر اموال متعلق به هریک از سازمان\\u200cها و مؤسسات مندرج در ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری به ذهن متبادر می\\u200cگردد همان مفاهیم عرفی است و سپرده شدن نیز اعم از سپردن مستقیم و یا غیرمستقیم می\\u200cباشد. به عبارت دیگر چگونگی سپردن وجه یا مال اعم از این\\u200cکه به وسیله مقامات و یا افراد به مؤسسات و دستگاه\\u200cهای موردنظر تحویل و بعد از طی مراحل اداری در اختیار کارمند قرارگرفته و این\\u200cکه توسط مقامات و یا افراد مستقیما به کارمندان مدنظر واگذارشده باشد ملاک تحقق سپرده شدن نبوده و فقط تحویل وجوه یا اموال به کارمندان آن هم حسب وظیفه موردتوجه است که چه به صورت واقعی و یا حکمی تحقق یابد و در باب بزه اختلاس تسلیم مال یا وجه ناشی از یک رابطه و قرارداد حقوقی ایجادشده در چهارچوب مقررات حقوقی اداری است. علاوه بر این\\u200cکه برداشت وجوه به منزله تصاحب و تملک آن به حساب می\\u200cآید یعنی در مورد وجوه به صرف برداشت، جرم به صورت تام واقع می\\u200cشود و مرتکب به عنوان مختلس قابل تعقیب جزایی خواهد بود. ولی در مورد سایر اموال بایستی رفتار مرتکب به صورت تصاحب بروز و ظهور پیدا کند تا جرم به شکل تام واقع شود. از طرفی در جرم اختلاس، بین محروم نمودن موقت یا دائم دستگاه\\u200cهای مذکور در ماده ۵ قانون اخیرالذکر از اموال متعلقه، تفاوتی وجود ندارد و به محض این\\u200cکه اندیشه مرتکب بر محرومیت دستگاه\\u200cهای موصوف از آن اموال تعلق گرفت، در آن صورت، موقت یا دائم بودن قصد محرومیت، تأثیری در تحقق جرم نداشته و این امر صرفا در مواردی در مجازات اثرگذار است. به علاوه استفاده یا عدم استفاده عملی شخص مرتکب از وجوه یا مال موضوع اختلاس تفاوتی در ماهیت جرم ایجاد نمی\\u200cکند. در این جرم مقنن خروج وجه یا مال از مالکیت دولت و سایر دستگاه\\u200cها را ملازم با نفع خود یا شخص دیگری دانسته، خواه شخص مرتکب، از آن وجه یا مال بهره\\u200cمند شده یا نشده باشد. افزون بر این برخلاف آنچه متهم تجدیدنظرخواه ادعا نموده، تحقیقات معموله و مستندات ابرازی حکایت از این امر داشته است که متهم تجدیدنظرخواه قصد محروم نمودن بانک را از وجوه دولتی از طریق تملک آن به نفع دیگری داشته است که خود گویای این مطلب است که در مانحن فیه بانک از تصرف عین مال محروم گردیده است. مضاف بر این\\u200cکه متهم صراحتا به برداشت و تصاحب وجوه سپرده شده جهت تسویه بدهی\\u200cهای شخصی خود اقرار و اذعان داشته است. بنابه مراتب ازآنجاکه از ناحیه تجدیدنظرخواه ایراد و اعتراض موجه و مؤثری که اساس و ارکان این قسمت از دادنامه معترض عنه را متزلزل نموده و مآلا موجبات نقض و گسیختن آن را فراهم نماید، به عمل نیامده است و بر مبانی استنباط و استدلال دادگاه نخستین خدشه و خللی مترتب نیست و از جهت رعایت اصول و قواعد دادرسی نیز اشکال اساسی که مؤثر در حکم بوده ملاحظه نمی\\u200cگردد. النهایه نظر به این\\u200cکه مقنن در خصوص جرم اختلاس در کلیه موارد مذکور در ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری در صورت وجود جهات و کیفیات مخففه، تخفیف مجازات را برابر تبصره ۶ ماده ۵ قانون یادشده تا حداقل مجازات مقرر در این ماده، حبس و انفصال دائم و موقت از خدمات دولتی پیش\\u200cبینی نموده و قاضی دادگاه را از اعمال مجازات کمتر از حداقل مجازات حبس و انفصال منع کرده است. به این ترتیب قاضی دادگاه در صورت وجود جهات مخففه در اختلاس موضوع ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری زائد بر پنجاه هزار ریال تنها اختیار اعمال حداقل دو سال حبس تعزیری و انفصال دائم از خدمات دولتی را دارد. لهذا اقدام دادگاه بدوی در مانحن فیه در تعیین مجازات حبس به مدت یک سال و نیز انفصال موقت از خدمات دولتی به مدت یک سال برخلاف مدار قانونی بوده است، اما ازآنجاکه در پرونده امر فقط متهم متقاضی تجدیدنظر بوده و شاکی خصوصی یا دادستان در این باب درخواستی نداشته\\u200cاند و با توجه به قاعده منع اصلاح به ضرر تجدیدنظرخواه که مانع از تصحیح حکم از این حیث خواهد بود لاجرم به تذکار به دادگاه بدوی بسنده می\\u200cشود. رأی دادگاه قطعی است.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۶۸ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران مستشار دادگاه. \\nمسعودی مقام غفوری گوراب\\n. \\n. \\n[end]', 'title': 'مفهوم سپردن مال در بزه اختلاس'}, {'text': 'رأی خلاصه جریان پرونده. این پرونده یک پدر و پسر بنام\\u200cهای ق. و ح. کشته\\u200cشده\\u200cاند در تاریخ ۱۳۸۴ / ۰۵ / ۲۹ و معطوف و مسبوق به یک سری اختلافاتی که در میان متهم الف. و ق. وجود داشته و منازعات و درگیری\\u200cهایی هم در این خصوص داشته\\u200cاند. در تاریخ ۱۳۸۴ / ۰۵ / ۲۹ در حالی که مرحوم ق. و فرزندش از زمین\\u200cهای کشاورزی بر می\\u200cگشته\\u200cاند در کوچه محل خانه\\u200cاش مورد هجوم یک موتور سوار قرار می\\u200cگیرند و کشته می\\u200cشوند. اولیاء دم از آنان الف. را هم جزء قاتلین احتمالی می\\u200cشمرند. پزشکی قانونی علت فوت ح. را اصابت گلوله به سینه و ق. را اصابت گلوله به پسر و متلاشی شدن جمجمه اعلام می\\u200cکند. شاهدی گفته است: الف. به طرف ح. شلیک کرد بالای سر ق. آمد او را هم مورد اصابت قرار داده، گواه دیگر گفته است: الف. مرحوم ق. و فرزندش را تهدید به مرگ می\\u200cکرد. نفر دیگر گفته است: دیدم ن. یک اسلحه کلاش داشت به طرف موتور آب س. تیراندازی می\\u200cکرد، بعد از چند روز ق. و پسرش را به قتل رسانده است. فرد دیگری بنام س. گفته است: ن. را دیده که اسلحه در دست سوار موتور بود، بعد از چند لحظه خبر رسید مرحوم و پسرش به قتل رسیده\\u200cاند. دادگاه قدر متقین حاصله از اظهارات شهود را ارتکاب قتل از سوی ن. دانسته است، اما این\\u200cکه الف. قاتل باشد را فاقد دلیل دانسته و صرفا پذیرفته است که الف. راننده موتور بوده است. الف. و م. از آغاز تا پایان هر گونه مشارکت یا مداخله خود در قتل را انکار می\\u200cکنند و دادگاه هم معتقد است دلیل یا مدرکی معتبر وجود ندارد که حداقل قادر باشد مشارکت الف. و معاونت م. را در این دو فقره قتل به اثبات برساند اما در مورد الف. معتقد است الف. به نوعی در حد همراهی کردن متهم اصلی ن. وی را مساعدت کرده است. بنا به آنچه یاد شد نظر به اظهارات اولیه اولیاء دم و با توجه به گزارش و نظریه\\u200cهای پزشکی قانونی و نظر به ثابت بودن اختلاف مؤثر فی ما بین متهم فراری ن. با مرحوم ق. و با توجه به این\\u200cکه الف. رابطه خویشاوندی نزدیکی با متهم ردیف اول دارد و با توجه به این\\u200cکه الف. حتی حضور و همراهی خود را با متهم متواری و در زمان صورت گرفتن قتلها انکار می\\u200cکند اظهار وی را مقرون به واقع ندانسته و نتیجه می\\u200cگیرد که محتویات پرونده دلالت دارد که حداقل دو نفر و با یک دستگاه موتورسیکلت به مرحومان حمله برده\\u200cاند که قطعا یکی در حال رانندگی بوده است و دومی هم به طرف ق. و ح. فرزندش تیراندازی کرده است و بالحاظ محتویات پرونده مجرمیت ن. را در حد مباشرت در ارتکاب قتل مرحومان ق. و ح. با تیراندازی با اسلحه جنگی همراه با قصد اصالی و ابتدایی و حصول نتیجه بوده است به این سبب متهم ن. را به دو فقره قصاص از طریق دار آویختن محکوم کرده است و در مورد متهم الف. نوشته است: در مورد الف. در حد معاونت در صورت گرفتن دو فقره قتل عمد از طریق همراه شدن و رساندن آگاهانه و عالمانه و عاملانه مباشر که مسلح هم بوده است به محل مسیر تردد آن پدر و فرزند و با علم کامل از قصد و هدف ن. باستناد قرائن قویه موجود محرز و ثابت می\\u200cباشد و معاونت انتسابی به نامبرده را باعتبار عمل مباشر جرم از مصادیق تعدد مادی محسوب داشته است و قید کرده معاونت در کشور ما به تبع و استعاره از مباشر جرم پذیری می\\u200cنماید و در مانحن فیه عمل مباشر جرم مصداق تعدد واقعی است و نتیجه معاونت هم در همین راستا ارزیابی می\\u200cگردد و نامبرده را به دو فقره پانزده سال حبس با رعایت ماده ۱۳۴ ق. م. ا. ۱۳۹۲ محکوم می\\u200cکند، اما مشارکت ن. در قتل و اتهام م. دایر به معاونت در قتل را فاقد دلیل دانسته حکم به برائت نامبردگان از این جهات داده است. لازم به ذکر است ن. را به اتهام مباشرت در دو فقره قتل به دو فقره قصاص به طور غیابی محکوم کرده است که قابل واخواهی است و فعلا در دیوان عالی کشور پرونده از جهت قصاص مطرح رسیدگی نیست و پرونده صرفا با اعتراض الف. و وکلای وی از جهت محکومیت نامبرده به دو فقره ۱۵ سال حبس به دیوان عالی کشور آمده است و در حال حاضر به اعتراض وی رسیدگی می\\u200cشود، وی در اعتراض خود گفته است: علم و آگاهی و نقش و ارتباطی با دو قتل یاد شده نداشته و وکیل وی نیز گفته است: اقراری از او ثبت\\u200cنشده است و هیچگونه دلیلی بر معاونت وی جود ندارد تقاضای نقض دادنامه را کرده\\u200cاند. اینک پس از تبادل نظر و مشورت ختم رسیدگی را اعلام به شرح برگ آتی مبادرت به صدور رأی می\\u200cنماید. هیئت شعبه در تاریخ بالا تشکیل گردید. پس از قرائت گزارش آقای علی\\u200cاکبر یساقی عضو ممیز و اوراق پرونده و نظریه کتبی آقای ح. علیخانی دادیار محترم دادسرای دیوان عالی کشور اجمالا مبنی بر موافقت با ابرام مفاد دادنامه صادره دارم. دادنامه شماره / ۹۲۰۹۹۷۳۴۱۹۰۰۰۲۸۲ مورخه ۱۳۹۲ / ۰۹ / ۲۴ تجدیدنظر خواسته مشاوره نموده، چنین رأی می\\u200cدهد.. رأی شعبه دیوان عالی کشور. اعتراض آقای الف. نسبت به دادنامه شماره / ۹۲۰۹۹۷۳۴۱۹۰۰۰۲۸۲ _ ۱۳۹۲ / ۰۹ / ۲۴ صادره از شعبه یک دادگاه کیفری استان کرمان وارد است، چون اولا: قتل در تاریخ ۲۹ / ۰۵ / ۱۳۸۴ واقع\\u200cشده است، ثانیا: به موجب ماده ۱۱ ق م اسلامی ۱۳۷۰ و ماده ۱۰ ق م اسلامی مصوب سال ۱۳۹۲ اعمال مجازات باید به موجب قانونی باشد که قبل از وقوع جرم مقرر شده باشد، ثالثا: به موجب ماده ۲۰۷ ق. م. ا. سال ۱۳۷۰ مجازات معاونت در قتل مجازات تعزیری است، رابعا: به موجب ماده ۴۶ ق مجازات اسلامی مصوب ۷۰ در جرایم قابل تعزیر هر گاه فعل واحدی دارای عناوین متعدد، جرم باشد مجازات جرمی داده می\\u200cشود که مجازات آن اشد باشد و به موجب ماده ۴۷ همان قانون، در تعدد جرم هر گاه جرایم ارتکابی مختلف باشد باید برای هر یک از جرایم مجازات جداگانه تعیین شود و اگر مختلف نباشد فقط یک مجازات تعیین می\\u200cگردد و در این قسمت تعدد جرم می\\u200cتواند از علل مشدده کیفر باشد و در مانحن فیه جرائم ارتکابی مشابه است نه مختلف دو معاونت در قتل مختلف نیست. اما بحث اعمال ماده ۱۱ ق. م. ا مصوب ۱۳۹۲ و ادعا خفیف بودن مجازات مقرر در ماده ۱۳۴ ق. م. ا. ۹۲ نیز محل تأمل است چون به موجب ماده ۱۳۴ ق. م. ا. ۹۲ به فرض این\\u200cکه آن را بر ماده ۴۷ ق. م. ا. سال ۱۳۷۰ بدانیم باید برای دو معاونت دو مجازات ۱۵ سال حبس را صادر کنیم که فقط یکی از دو پانزده سال قابل اجراست، لیکن اگر به هر علت یکی از دو ۱۵ سال غیرقابل اجراء شود ۱۵ سال بعدی اجراء می\\u200cشود در حالی که به موجب ماده ۴۷ یک ۱۵ سال تعیین می\\u200cشود و می\\u200cتوان آن را مثلا دو سال تشدید کرد و اگر به هر علت ۲ + ۱۵ سال غیر قابل اجراء شود دیگر مجازاتی وجود ندارد تا علیه محکوم اجراء شود. نتیجه اینکه مجازات جدید که تعیین دو پانزده سال مستقل است شدیدتر است به علاوه در م. ۴۷ تعدد می\\u200cتواند از علل مشدده باشد یعنی قاضی می\\u200cتواند هم تشدید نکند و فقط یک ۱۵ سال حبس بدهد در حالی که به موجب ماده ۱۳۴ لزوما باید حکم به دو فقره ۱۵ سال حبس صادر شود. افزون بر همه اینها شرط تحقق معاونت، وحدت قصد است در حالی که مباشر جرم فراری است و الغایب علی حجته چگونه می\\u200cتوان این شرط را محقق دانست اگر مباشر در مقام دفاع ابراز کند که قتل دفعتا و بدون برنامه\\u200cریزی قبلی واقع شد چگونه شرط را محقق می\\u200cدانیم با توجه به آنچه یاد شد حکم صادره مطابق با موازین نیست باستناد بند ۴ شق ب. م. ۲۶۵ ق. آ. د. ک. نقض جهت رسیدگی به شعبه هم\\u200cعرض ارجاع می\\u200cگردد. این حکم قطعی است. \\n. \\nرئیس شعبه ۱۳ دیوان عالی کشور - مستشار\\n. \\nعلی\\u200cاصغر باغانی - علی\\u200cاکبر یساقی -

میلیارد و سیصد و پنج میلیون ریال از وجوه بانک ملی شعبه … تهران و علیه آقای س. س. به اتهام معاونت در اختلاس کیفرخواست صادر نموده است. دادستان به گزارش بانک و اقرار متهمان استناد جسته است. در شکایت اولیه ادعا شده که آقای الف. س. مبلغ ۷۷۳۵۰۰۰۰۰۰ ریال به حساب آقای الف. ق. بدون مجوز قانونی واریز و تا زمان شکایت مبلغ ۴۳۰۵۰۰۰۰۰۰ ریال آن را مسترد نکرده است (ص ۱۹). آقای س. در دفاع اظهار نموده است که اتهام را قبول ندارد و بدون سوءنیت اقدام به این کار کرده است. آقای س. س. در دفاع اظهار نموده است که اتهام را قبول ندارد و از آقای الف. س. تقاضا نموده که پس از واریز مبلغ به حساب وی چک را پاس نماید. وکلای متهمان سوءنیت آنها را منتفی اعلام کرده است. به نظر دادگاه با توجه به اظهارات متهم ردیف اول گزارش بانک تصویر فیش واریزی و پرینت حساب اتهام متهم اول ثابت و با توجه به اینکه اداره امور شعب غرب تهران اعلام نموده است کل وجوه در مورخ ۱۰ / / ۱۱ / ۹۰ (قبل از صدور کیفرخواست) به بانک اعاده شده است، دادگاه به استناد ماده (۵) تبصره ۳ و ۶ آن آقای الف. س. را به تحمل دو سال حبس، هفت میلیون ریال جزای نقدی با احتساب ایام بازداشت و انفصال دائم از مشاغل دولتی محکوم و اجرای مجازات حبس را معلق می\\u200cنماید. اما در خصوص اتهام آقای س. س. دلایل دادستان مثبت وحدت قصد وی با مباشر جرم و تحقق یکی از مصادیق معاونت ندارد، بنابراین دادگاه به استناد بند الف ماده ۱۷۷ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری حکم بر برائت آقای س. س. صادر می\\u200cنماید. رأی صادره حضوری و ظرف بیست روز از تاریخ ابلاغ، قابل تجدیدنظر در دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران است.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۱۱۷۷ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران کریمی. رأی دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان. تجدیدنظرخواهی آقای م. غ. به وکالت از آقای الف. س. فرزند م. کارمند بانک ملی ایران شعبه … نسبت به دادنامه شماره ۹۰۰۹۹۷۲۱۸۱۷۰۱۳۷۹ مورخ ۲۷ / ۱۲ / ۱۳۹۰ صادره از شعبه ۱۱۷۷ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران که طی آن متهم تجدیدنظرخواه به اتهام اختلاس به میزان ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۵ / ۴ ریال به تحمل دو سال حبس تعزیری و پرداخت جزای نقدی به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۷۰۰۰ ریال در حق دولت و انفصال از خدمات دولتی محکوم و اجرای مجازات حبس وی بدون تعیین مدت تعلیق گردیده، وارد به نظر نمی\\u200cرسد. چه آنکه متهم تجدیدنظرخواه آقای الف. س. از زمره کارکنان و مستخدمین موضوع ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشا، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری بوده که اموال و وجوه بانک ملی ایران به طور مستقیم و غیرمستقیم بنابر مقتضای وظیفه اداریش به او سپرده شده که وظیفه حفظ و حراست از اموال و وجوه دولتی را بر عهده داشته و به رغم منع و حذر قانون با سوءاستفاده از مقام و موقعیت شغلی و آن هم با سبق تصمیم و برنامه\\u200cای از پیش طراحی\\u200cشده با توسل به یکسری اعمال به ظاهر قانونی ولی در اصل مغایر با قوانین و مقررات مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۳۵ / ۷ ریال از وجوه متعلق به بانک ملی ایران را از طریق صدور برگه داخلی و طی فیش نقدی بانکی به شماره ۱۶۷۸۲۳ مورخ ۸ / ۱۱ / ۱۳۹۰ در راستای پرداخت چک آقای س. س. به حساب جاری شماره ۰۱۰۵۷۷۹۲۲۵۰۰۹ مربوط به آقای الف. ق. برداشت و تصاحب نموده است. اضافه بر اینکه در این بین در اختیار شخص اداری قرار گرفتن وجوه مورد اختلاس که از جمله شرایط تحقق این جرم است به نظر می\\u200cرسد در پرونده امر تحقق\\u200cیافته است، چون آنچه از مفهوم سپرده شدن وجوه نقدی، مطالبات، حوالجات یا سهام و یا سایر اسناد و اوراق بهادار یا سایر اموال متعلق به هر یک از سازمانها و مؤسسات مندرج در ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشا، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری به ذهن متبادر می\\u200cگردد همان متفاهم عرفی است و سپرده شدن نیز از اعم از سپردن مستقیم و یا غیرمستقیم می\\u200cباشد. به عبارت دیگر چگونگی سپردن وجه یا مال اعم از اینکه به وسیله مقامات و یا افراد به مؤسسات و دستگاه\\u200cهای موردنظر تحویل و بعد از طی مراحل اداری در اختیار کارمند قرار گرفته و اینکه توسط مقامات و یا افراد مستقیما به کارمندان مدنظر واگذار شده باشد ملاک تحقق سپرده شدن نبوده و فقط تحویل وجوه یا اموال به کارمندان آن هم حسب وظیفه مورد توجه می\\u200cباشد که چه به صورت واقعی و یا حکمی تحقق یابد و در باب بزه اختلاس تسلیم مال یا وجه ناشی از یک رابطه و قرارداد حقوقی ایجاد شده در چهارچوب مقررات حقوقی اداری است. علاوه بر اینکه برداشت وجوه به منزله تصاحب و تملک آن به حساب می\\u200cآید یعنی در مورد وجوه به صرف برداشت، جرم به صورت تام واقع می\\u200cشود و مرتکب به عنوان مختلس قابل تعقیب جزایی خواهد بود. ولی در مورد سایر اموال بایستی رفتار مرتکب به صورت تصاحب بروز و ظهور پیدا کند تا جرم به شکل تام واقع شود. از طرفی در جرم اختلاس، بین محروم نمودن موقت یا دائم دستگاه\\u200cهای مذکور در ماده ۵ قانون اخیرالذکر از اموال متعلقه، تفاوتی وجود ندارد و به محض اینکه اندیشه مرتکب بر محرومیت دستگاه\\u200cهای موصوف از آن اموال تعلق گرفت، در آن صورت، موقت یا دائم بودن قصد محرومیت، تأثیری در تحقق جرم نداشته و این امر صرفا در مواردی در مجازات جزای نقدی اثرگذار است. به علاوه استفاده یا عدم استفاده عملی شخص مرتکب از وجوه یا مال موضوع اختلاس تفاوتی در ماهیت جرم ایجاد نمی\\u200cکند. در این جرم مقنن خروج وجه یا مال از مالکیت دولت و سایر دستگاه\\u200cها را ملازم با نفع خود یا شخص دیگری دانسته، خواه شخص مرتکب، از آن وجه یا مال بهره\\u200cمند شده یا نشده باشد. افزون بر این برخلاف آنچه وکیل تجدیدنظرخواه ادعا نموده، تحقیقات معموله و مستندات ابرازی حکایت از این امر داشته است که متهم تجدیدنظرخواه قصد محروم نمودن بانک ملی ایران را از وجوه دولتی از طریق تملک آن به نفع دیگری داشته که خود گویای این مطلب است که نمی\\u200cتوان عمل ارتکابی را استفاده غیرمجاز از وجوه و اموال دولتی موضوع ماده ۵۹۸ قانون مجازات اسلامی (تعزیرات و مجازاتهای بازدارنده) مصوب ۱۳۷۵ دانست چرا که در بزه استفاده غیرمجاز از وجوه و اموال دولتی، دولت از مالکیت عین مال چه به صورت موقت و چه دائم محروم نمی\\u200cشود و صرفا از منافع آن در کوتاه مدت محروم می\\u200cشود. این در حالی است که در مانحن فیه بانک ملی ایران از مالکیت عین مال محروم گردیده است. بنا به مراتب اگرچه رأی تجدیدنظرخواسته از حیث دلایل وقوع جرم اختلاس و انتساب آن به متهم تجدیدنظرخواه آقای الف. س. و ماده استنادی صحیحا اصدار یافته و از جهت رعایت اصول و قواعد دادرسی و مبانی استنباط و نحوه استدلال و طرق استنتاج دادگاه بدوی نیز خالی از منقصت قانونی است که سبب تزلزل رأی معترض عنه گردد، اما دادنامه تجدیدنظرخواسته از حیث تعیین میزان وجوه موضوع اختلاس و عدم تعیین مدت تعلیق اجرای مجازات حبس واجد ایراد و اشکال قانونی است که به اساس رأی لطمه وارد نمی\\u200cسازد. زیرا اولا میزان وجه مورد اختلاس در پرونده کار ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۳۵ / ۷ ریال بوده که دادگاه بدوی آن را ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۵ / ۴ ریال به میزان باقیمانده وجه مورد اختلاس تا تاریخ طرح شکایت کیفری که متهم تجدیدنظرخواه آن را مسترد ننموده، مورد احتساب قرار داده است در صورتی که استرداد بخش یا تمام وجه موضوع اختلاس مؤثر در محاسبه اصل وجه یا مال مورد اختلاس نمی\\u200cباشد. ثانیا: هر چند مخالف ماده ۳۰ قانون مجازات اسلامی در صورت وجود موجبات تعلیق اجرای مجازات حبس در بزه اختلاس بر طبق تبصره ۳ ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشا، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری در مواردی که متهم به ارتکاب جرم اختلاس، تمام وجه یا مال مورد اختلاس را قبل از صدور کیفرخواست مسترد دارد، مجازات حبس مورد حکم تعلیق می\\u200cشود، ولی این امر بدان معنا نیست که مدت تعلیق اجرای مجازات که برابر ماده ۲۵ قانون مجازات اسلامی ۱۳۷۰ دو تا پنج سال تعیین گردیده، نادیده انگاشته شود. در پرونده امر دادگاه نخستین اجرای مجازات حبس در مورد متهم تجدیدنظرخواه را بدون تعیین مدت مقرر در ماده ۲۵ قانون مذکور تعلیق کرده است. از اینرو دادگاه به تجویز ماده ۲۵۰ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری و تبصره ۴ ماده ۲۲ قانون تشکیل دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب دادنامه تجدیدنظرخواسته را از حیث میزان وجه مورد اختلاس از مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۵ / ۴ ریال به ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۳۵ / ۷ ریال و از جهت مدت تعلیق اجرای حبس به استناد ماده ۲۵ قانون مجازات اسلامی ۱۳۷۰ با تعیین مدت سه سال برای اجرای مجازات حبس اصلاح می\\u200cنماید، لذا ضمن رد تجدیدنظرخواهی به عمل آمده، دادنامه تجدیدنظرخواسته را با اصلاح صورت گرفته تأیید و استوار می\\u200cنماید. رأی دادگاه قطعی است.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۶۸ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران مستشار دادگاه. \\nمسعودیمقام بیک وردی. \\n. \\nدر پرونده فوق آقای الف. س. کارمند بانک ملی ایران شعبه … (خواهان اعاده دادرسی) در مورخه ۸ / ۱۱ / ۹۰ مبادرت به واریز وجهی به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۵۰۰ / ۷۷۳ ریال از موجودی بانک به حساب شماره … به نام شخصی با هویت الف. ق. بدون مجوز قانونی و بدون اجازه رئیس شعبه می\\u200cنماید. حسب اظهارات خواهان اعاده دادرسی مبنی بر اینکه «طی درخواست یکی از مشتریان خوش\\u200cحساب بانک به نام آقای س. س. مبلغ مذکور را به حساب نامبرده واریز کردم و در قبال آن چکی دریافت نمودم که قرار بود تا یک ساعت بعد وجه فوق تأمین موجودی شود ولی متأسفانه چک موردنظر تأمین موجودی نگردیده و موضوع به فردای آن روز یعنی ۱۰ / ۱۱ / ۹۰ موکول شد» ; بر همین منوال اقامه دعوی و شکوائیه\\u200cای از سوی نماینده حقوقی بانک ملی ایران اداره امور شعب غرب تهران تنظیم و تقدیم دادسرای مربوطه می\\u200cگردد مبنی بر اینکه تاکنون مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۴۳۰ / ۳ ریال مسترد و مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۵ / ۴ ریال هم چنان به بانک بازگشت نشده است (صفحه ۹)، و به دنبال آن درخواست تعقیب و مجازات مشارالیه به اتهام اختلاس نموده است. در این مرحله شخصی که خود را مشتری بانک معرفی نموده است در بازجویی از وی به اتهام معاونت در جرم اختلاس بعد از اعلام هویت خود با نام س. س. به شرح صفحه ۲۲ پرونده اظهار می\\u200cدارد: (بنده چکی را به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۳۵ / ۷ ریال بابت خرید ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۰ / ۱ درهم صادر کرده بودم که صبح ساعت ۸ صبح با مراجعه به بانک ملی محل کار آقای الف. س. عرض کردم انشاء اله تا ساعت ۹ الی ۵ / ۹ وجه چک تأمین خواهد شد و ایشان یعنی آقای س. صرفا به اعتبار حرف بنده وجه چک را به حساب آقای ق. واریز نموده\\u200cاند که به ایشان عرض کردم چرا چنین کاری را انجام داده\\u200cاند و تا آخر وقت همان روز مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۴۳۰ / ۱ ریال آن را واریز و سپس مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۵۰۰ ریال دیگر باز هم در همان روز واریز کردم و تا این ساعت از مورخه ۱۰ / ۱۱ / ۹۰ مابقی را تأمین و فقط ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۰۰ ریال آن باقی\\u200cمانده که الباقی نیز تا ظهر امروز واریز خواهد شد). النهایه دادسرای محترم مورخه ۱۱ / ۱۱ / ۹۰ بعد از انجام تحقیقات لازم مبادرت به صدور قرار مجرمیت و کیفرخواست علیه هر دو متهم پرونده نموده و متعاقبا اداره شاکی به شرح صفحه ۵۴ پرونده اعلام رضایت و پرونده جهت ادامه رسیدگی و صدور حکم به دادگاه ارسال و در شعبه ۱۱۷۷ مورد رسیدگی و منجر به صدور دادنامه شماره ۹۰۰۹۹۷۲۱۸۱۷۰۱۳۷۹ مورخ ۲۷ / ۱۲ / ۹۰ گردیده است که به موجب آن خواهان اعاده دادرسی به اتهام اختلاس به دو سال حبس و هفت میلیون ریال جزای نقدی در حق دولت و انفصال دائم از مشاغل دولتی محکوم می\\u200cگردد و دادگاه بدوی بدون قید زمان حبس نامبرده را معلق می\\u200cنماید که به این رأی وکیل خواهان اعاده دادرسی آقای غ. اعتراض و درخواست تجدیدنظرخواهی می\\u200cنماید که به شعبه ۶۸ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان ارجاع و مورد رسیدگی و با اصلاح میزان وجه مورد اختلاس از ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۳۰۵ / ۴ ریال به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۰۰۰ / ۷۳۵ / ۷ ریال و تعیین مدت تعلیق حبس به مدت سه سال دادنامه بدوی را تأیید می\\u200cنماید. با عنایت به مراتب فوق محکوم علیه آقای الف. س. به آرای صادره اعتراض و از دیوانعالی کشور تقاضای اعاده دادرسی نموده است که پرونده در شعبه بیستم دیوانعالی کشور مورد رسیدگی و مداقه قرار گرفته و به موجب دادنامه شماره ۹۲۰۹۹۷۰۹۰۸۰۰۰۱۹۱ مورخ ۲۷ / ۳ / ۹۲ و با استدلال اینکه موضوع اتهامی در حدود ماده ۵۹۸ قانون مجازات اسلامی تشخیص و تجویز اعاده دادرسی را پذیرفته و جهت رسیدگی مجدد به این شعبه ارجاع و تحت نظر قرار گرفته است. دادگاه با مطالبه پرونده محاکماتی مربوطه و تشکیل جلسه دادرسی و استماع اظهارات محکوم علیه و وکیل نامبرده و نیز نماینده حقوقی اداره شاکی رسیدگی مجدد جامع اوراق و مستندات پرونده به خصوص شرایط و نحوه دقیق وقوع عمل ارتکابی و موقعیت خاصی که خواهان اعاده دادرسی به واسطه آن مرتکب اقدام غیرقانونی یعنی استفاده غیرمجاز از وجوهی که حسب وظیفه قانونی در اختیار داشته است و قطع نظر از اینکه اداره شاکی با دریافت و استرداد کامل وجوه مورد ادعای و حتی اخذ بهره متعلقه آن مبادرت به اعلام رضایت نموده است و نظر به احراز این مهم که نامبرده در اعمال ارتکابی خود قصد تملک وجه مذکور به نفع خود یا دیگری نداشته است و صرفا از دارایی بانک (وجه) به نحو موقت و جهت پرداخت بدهی غیر سوءاستفاده نموده است. لذا بنابه مراتب مشروحه فوق و آنچه در ملاحظه مستندات ابرازی و موجود در پرونده حاصل\\u200cشده است اعمال مجرمانه خواهان اعاده دادرسی هیچ انطباقی با جرم اختلاس و عنصر قانونی استنادی در آرای محکومیت وی نداشته به همین دلیل و با استناد به ماده ۲۷۴ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری با پذیرش و قبول اعاده دادرسی موضوع مفاد دادنامه شماره ۹۲۰۹۹۷۰۹۰۸۰۰۰۱۹۱ صادره از شعبه بیستم دیوان عالی کشور و با نقض دادنامه\\u200cهای محاکم بدوی و تجدیدنظر به ترتیب به شماره\\u200cهای ۹۰۰۹۹۷۷۲۱۸۱۷۰۱۳۷۹ و ۹۱۰۹۹۷۲۱۳۱۳۰۰۱۷۴ عمل محکوم علیه آقای الف. س. را برابر ماده ۵۹۸ قانون مجازات اسلامی تشخیص داده و توجها به جلب رضایت شاکی و جبران خسارت وارده به اتهام تصرف غیرمجاز در اموال دولتی با رعایت تبصره ۲ ماده ۲۲ قانون تشکیل دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب وی

۹۱۰۹۹۷۰۲۳۰۶۰۰۲۲۷ مورخ ۱۵ / ۰۷ / ۱۳۹۱ صادره از شعبه ۱۰۸۳ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران که طی آن متهم تجدیدنظرخواه به اتهام اختلاس به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۱۱۲ / ۲۰ ریال به تحمل دو سال حبس تعزیری و پرداخت جزای نقدی به مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۱۱۲ / ۲۰ ریال در حق دولت و انفصال موقت از خدمات دولتی به مدت یک سال محکوم گردیده، وارد به نظر نمی\\u200cرسد. چه آنکه متهم تجدیدنظرخواه آقای م. ش. از زمره کارکنان و مستخدمین موضوع ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری مصوب ۱۳۶۷ بوده که اموال و وجوه بانک به طور مستقیم و غیر مستقیم بنا بر مقتضای وظیفه اداریش به او سپرده شده که وظیفه حفظ و حراست از اموال و وجوه دولتی را بر عهده داشته و به رغم منع و حذر قانون با سوءاستفاده از مقام و موقعیت شغلی و آن هم با سبق تصمیم و برنامه\\u200cای از پیش طراحی\\u200cشده با توسل به یک سری اعمال به ظاهر قانونی ولی در اصل مغایر با قوانین و مقررات مبلغ ۰۰۰ / ۱۱۲ / ۲۰ ریال از وجوه حاصله از باز پرداخت اقساط تسهیلات و مبالغ موجود در صندوق بانک را به نفع خود برداشت و تصاحب نموده است. اضافه بر اینکه در این بین در اختیار شخص اداری قرارگرفتن وجوه مورد اختلاس که از جمله شرایط تحقق این جرم است به نظر می\\u200cرسد در پرونده امر تحقق\\u200cیافته است، چون آنچه از مفهوم سپرده شدن وجوه نقدی، مطالبات، حواله جات یا سهام و یا سایر

عرفی است و سپرده شدن نیز از اعم از سپردن مستقیم و یا غیرمستقیم می\\u200cباشد. به عبارت دیگر چگونگی سپردن وجه یا مال اعم از اینکه به وسیله مقامات و یا افراد به مؤسسات و دستگاه\\u200cهای مورد نظر تحویل

بایستی رفتار مرتکب به صورت تصاحب بروز و ظهور پیداکند تا جرم به شکل تام واقع شود. از طرفی در جرم اختلاس، بین محروم نمودن موقت یا دائم دستگاه\\u200cهای مذکور در ماده ۵ قانون اخیرالذکر از اموال متعلقه،

وجوه متعلق به بانک را برداشت و تصاحب نموده است و اساسا در زمان وقوع جرم بانک از جمله بانک\\u200cهای دولتی بوده که تحت شمول ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری مصوب ۱۳۶۷ قرار داشته است و توجها به اینکه در وصف صدق مدعای وکیل متهم تجدیدنظرخواه ماده ۲ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری مصوب ۱۳۶۷ که رکن قانونی بزه تحصیل مال از طریق نامشروع را تشکیل می\\u200cدهد ناظر به مواردی است که شخص یا اشخاصی مرتکب رفتاری در محدوده خرید و فروش یا سوء استفاده از مجوز صادرات و واردات و آنچه که عرفا موافقت اصولی گفته می\\u200cشود و همچنین تقلب در توزیع کالاهای دارای ضوابط مشخص گردند که به تحصیل مال از طریق نامشروع بیانجامد و اساسا هر نحو دارا شدن غیر عادلانه و نامشروع مادامی که ارکان و شرایط مقرر در ماده ۲ قانون مرقوم جمع و فراهم نباشد، نمی\\u200cتواند متصف به این وصف مجرمانه گردد به بیان دیگر میان دو مفهوم کلی یعنی بزه تحصیل مال از طریق نامشروع و تحصیل نامشروع ثروت و افزودن ناروا به دارایی\\u200cها از میان نسب اربعه، رابطه عموم و خصوص مطلق برقرار بوده یعنی هر تحصیل مال نامشروعی که مشمول ماده ۲ قانون مرقوم باشد بی\\u200cگمان مصداق دارا شدن غیر عادلانه نیز خواهد بود ولی عکس این قضیه همواره صادق نخواهد بود و عنایتا به اینکه همان گونه که اشارت گردید تا زمانی که ارکان و شرایط مقرر در ماده ۲ قانون فوق الاشعار جمع نباشد، مجرمانه قلمداد کردن عمل و تعیین کیفر برای مرتکب آن برخلاف منظور قانونگذار بوده است. و نظر به اینکه به دلالت تبصره ۳ ماده ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری مصوب ۱۳۶۷ استرداد تمام وجه مورد اختلاس آن هم قبل از صدور کیفرخواست موجب تعلیق اجرای مجازات حبس و معافیت از تمام یا قسمتی از جزای نقدی می\\u200cگردد و اساسا عدم حضور متهم تجدیدنظرخواه در مراحل تحقیقات مقدماتی و دادرسی با وصف عدم دسترسی به وی و احضار وی از طریق انتشار آگهی در روزنامه کثیر الانتشار و متعاقب آن پرداخت وجه مورد اختلاس قبل از رسیدگی به واخواهی به معنای استرداد تمام وجه مورد اختلاس قبل از صدور کیفرخواست نیست. علی\\u200cهذا بنا به مراتب از آنجا که وکیل متهم تجدیدنظرخواه ایراد و اعتراض موجه و مؤثری که اساس و ارکان دادنامه معترض عنه را متزلزل نموده و مآلا موجبات نقض و گسیختن آن رافراهم نماید، به عمل نیاورده است و بر مبانی استدلال و استنباط دادگاه نخستین خدشه و خللی مترتب نیست و از طرفی از حیث دلایل احراز بزه و انتساب آن به متهم تجدیدنظرخواه و انطباق آن با قانون و رعایت اصول و قواعد دادرسی نیز اشکال اساسی که مؤثر در حکم بوده، ملاحظه نمی\\u200cگردد النهایه نظر به اینکه به موجب ۵ قانون تشدید مجازات مرتکبین ارتشاء، اختلاس و کلاهبرداری مصوب ۱۳۶۷ در صورتی که میزان اختلاس بیش از مبلغ پنجاه هزار ریال باشد مرتکب به انفصال دائم از خدمات دولتی محکوم می\\u200cشود و توجها به اینکه دادگاه بدوی در مانحن فیه با اعمال کیفیات مخففه قضایی، مجازات متهم تجدیدنظرخواه را برخلاف تبصره ۶ ماده ۵ قانون مرقوم از انفصال دائم از خدمات دولتی به انفصال موقت از خدمات دولتی به مدت یک سال تنزل داده است بر این مبنا رأی تجدیدنظرخواسته واجد ایراد و اشکال است. اما چون صرفا متهم درخواست تجدیدنظر نموده و شاکی خصوصی یا دادستان درخواست تجدیدنظر نکرده\\u200cاند. دادگاه عنایتا به قاعده منع اصلاح به ضرر تجدیدنظرخواه در این باب به تذکر دادگاه بدوی بسنده می\\u200cکند لهذا دادگاه ضمن رد تجدیدنظرخواهی توجها به بند «الف» ماده ۲۵۷ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری مصوب ۱۳۷۸ نتیجتا دادنامه تجدیدنظرخواسته را تأیید و استوار می\\u200cنماید رأی دادگاه قطعی است.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۶۸ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران- مستشار دادگاه. \\nمسعودی مقام - بیک وردی\\n. \\n. \\n[end]', 'title': 'اختلاس'}, {'text': 'رأی دادگاه بدوی. در خصوص اتهام آقایان م. ک. و ح. ف. دایر بر مشارکت در معامله به قصد فرار از دین، با ملاحظه جمیع اوراق پرونده و توجها به شکایت خانم الف. ح. با ملاحظه رأی شماره ۱۲۰۸ مورخ ۲۲ / ۶ / ۸۹ صادره از شعبه ۲۵۹ و رأی قطعی شماره ۰۰۱۰۹ صادره از شعبه ۳۰ دادگاه تجدیدنظر در ارتباط با تنظیم سند شماره ثبتی ۱۰۷۰۶ / ۴۸ بخش ۱۱ تهران موضوع یک دستگاه آپارتمان و با ملاحظه سند رسمی ۱۶۷۱ مورخ ۲۳ / ۱۰ / ۸۹ که حکایت از انتقال سند رسمی پلاک فوق پس از ۲۰ روز از قطعیت دادنامه صادره دارد که همگی حکایت از معامله طرفین به قصد فرار از دین می\\u200cباشد. لذا بزهکاری نامبردگان محرز و مسلم تشخیص و مستندا به ماده ۴ قانون نحوه اجرای محکومیت\\u200cهای مالی متهم ح. ف. را به تحمل شش ماه حبس تعزیری و متهم م. ک. را با رعایت بند ۵ ماده ۲۲ قانون مرقوم مجازات اسلامی به پرداخت یک\\u200cمیلیون ریال جزای نقدی بدل از حبس در حق صندوق دولت محکوم می\\u200cنماید. رأی صادره نسبت به آقای ک. حضوری و ظرف بیست روز پس از ابلاغ قابل تجدیدنظرخواهی در محاکم تجدیدنظر و نسبت به متهم دیگر غیابی و ظرف ده روز پس از ابلاغ، قابل واخواهی در این دادگاه و سپس ظرف بیست روز قابل تجدیدنظرخواهی در محاکم محترم تجدیدنظر استان تهران می\\u200cباشد.. \\nدادرس شعبه ۱۱۷۵ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران پورعظیم. \\n. \\nدر خصوص واخواهی آقای ع. الف. وکیل دادگستری به وکالت از آقای ح. ف. نسبت به قسمتی از دادنامه غیابی به شماره ۷۴۳ - ۲۶ / ۷ / ۹۰ صادره از این دادگاه که به موجب آن موکل وی به اتهام مشارکت در معامله به قصد فرار از دین از طریق انتقال گرفتن ملک پلاک ثبتی ۱۰۷۰۶ / ۴۸ بخش ۱۱ تهران از متهم دیگر پرونده آقای م. ک. در تاریخ ۲۳ / ۱۱ / ۸۹ به تحمل شش ماه حبس تعزیری محکوم گردیده است؛ دادگاه با بررسی اوراق پرونده، نظر به این\\u200cکه واخواه در لایحه اعتراضیه تقدیمی دلیل موجهی که موجب نقض دادنامه معترض عنه از این حیث گردد ارائه ننموده است و ادعای عدم آگاهی موکلش از موضوع، با وجود دلایل و مستندات موجود در پرونده قابل پذیرش نیست زیرا علاوه بر فاصله ناچیز زمانی تاریخ انتقال ملک ۲۳ / ۱۱ / ۸۹ از تاریخ صدور حکم قطعی دادگاه تجدیدنظر بر محکومیت آقای م. ک. به الزام به تنظیم سند آن ملک در حق شاکی (خانم الف. ح.) طی دادنامه شماره ۰۰۱۰۹۰ - ۳ / ۱۱ / ۸۹ شعبه ۳۰ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران، مفاد مبایعه نامه عادی استنادی به تاریخ ۳ / ۷ / ۸۶ به لحاظ غیر متعارف بودن ثمن معامله و کیفیت پرداخت آن و نیز تنظیم آن خارج از بنگاه املاک و مستأجر شدن خود فروشنده در آن و موارد دیگر دلالت ضمنی بر علم و آگاهی منتقل الیه از موضوع داشته است، هر چند انتقال موضوع اتهام انتسابی نیز انتقال رسمی مورخ ۲۳ / ۱۱ / ۸۹ بوده و بر فرض واقعی بودن تاریخ مبایعه نامه عادی، تأخیر طولانی مدت حدود سه ساله برای انتقال رسمی آن توجیه\\u200cپذیر نیست. دادگاه بنابه مراتب و با توجه به مفاد دادنامه شماره ۶۰۰۲۲۵ - ۲۸ / ۳ / ۹۰ شعبه ۱۲۹ دادگاه حقوقی تهران و دادنامه شماره ۱۰۵۱۳۲ - ۱۹ / ۱۰ / ۹۰ شعبه ۴۱ دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان تهران، واخواهی نامبرده را موجه ندانسته و مستندا به مواد ۲۱۷ و ۲۱۸ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری ضمن رد واخواهی وی دادنامه واخواسته را از این حیث تأیید می\\u200cنماید. در خصوص رد مال و استیفاء حقوق شاکیه همان گونه که در رأی اخیر دادگاه تجدیدنظر آمده است، به استناد ماده ۴ قانون نحوه اجرای محکومیت\\u200cهای مالی شاکیه قادر به استیفاء حق بوده تا بر اساس رأی قطعی الزام به تنظیم سند و پس از قطعیت رأی به ابطال سند تنظیمی به نام متهم ف.، اقدام قانونی نماید. رأی صادره حضوری و ظرف بیست روز پس از ابلاغ، قابل تجدیدنظرخواهی در محاکم تجدیدنظر استان می\\u200cباشد.. \\nرئیس شعبه ۱۱۷۵ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران پورعبدالله. رأی دادگاه تجدیدنظر استان. آقای م. ک. و خانم الف. ح. به طرفیت همدیگر از دادنامه ۷۴۳ ۲۶ / ۷ / ۹۰ شعبه ۱۱۷۵ دادگاه عمومی جزایی تهران تجدیدنظرخواهی نموده\\u200cاند. طبق دادنامه مذکور خانم الف. ح. علیه آقایان م. ک. و ح. ف. به اتهام مشارکت در انجام معامله به قصد فرار از دین شکایت نموده، مدیون به پرداخت صد هزار تومان پرداخت جزای نقدی با اعمال ماده ۲۲ قانون مجازات اسلامی که علت اعمال تخفیف ذکر نشده محکوم\\u200cشده درحالیکه انتقال گیرنده به تحمل شش ماه حبس محکوم\\u200cشده. آقای ک. از جهت محکومیت و خانم ح. از جهت کمی مجازات تجدیدنظرخواهی نموده\\u200cاند. با توجه به نظریه\\u200cای که در شعبه ۴۱ تجدیدنظر ذکر شده توضیح داده می\\u200cشود که گرچه مطابقت عمل تجدیدنظرخواه به هر دو اتهام انتقال مال غیر و یا معامله به قصد فرار از دین نزدیک است ولی عملی که متهم انجام داده با شرح آن مورد شکایت شاکی خصوصی قرار گرفته. دادسرا یا دادگاه بدوی و یا تجدیدنظر در مطابقت عمل با عنوان و مواد قانونی آزادند. برائت متهم به شرحی که ذکر شده از اتهام معامله به قصد فرار از دین و سپس تعقیب او به اتهام انتقال مال غیر به شرح دادرسی جداگانه ضروری به نظر نمی\\u200cرسد و به نظر می\\u200cرسد عمل انجام\\u200cشده همانطور که شاکیه نیز در شکایت اولیه ذکر نموده به اتهام معامله به قصد فرار از دین نزدیک\\u200cتر باشد زیرا اولا در ماده ۴ قانون نحوه اجرای محکومیت\\u200cهای مالی ذکر شده (هر کسی به قصد فرار از ادای دین و تعهدات مالی موضوع اسناد لازم\\u200cالاجرا و کلیه محکومیت\\u200cهای مالی مال خود را به دیگری انتقال دهد …) و در این مورد نیز رأی دادگاه حقوقی محکومیت مالی است. ثانیا در رأی دادگاه حقوقی خوانده ملزم به تنظیم سند رسمی به نام خواهان شده و این رأی به تنهایی تملیک مال نیست بلکه از موجبات تملیک مال است و حسب اظهارات خواهان نیز، خوانده متعهد به تملیک مال شده تا زمانی که تملیک انجام\\u200cنشده خوانده مدیون می\\u200cباشد و انتقال مال مورد دین مشمول اتهام معامله به قصد فرار از دین می\\u200cباشد و تجدیدنظرخواهی آقای ک. بدون دلیل و مدرک و غیرموجه می\\u200cباشد و رد می\\u200cشود طبق ماده ۲۵۸ قانون آیین دادرسی دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب در امور کیفری و ماده ۲۲ قانون تشکیل دادگاه\\u200cهای عمومی و انقلاب چون مقصر اصلی تجدیدنظرخواه به پرداخت صد هزار تومان جزای نقدی و خریدار ملک به تحمل شش ماه حبس محکوم\\u200cشده، با توجه به اعتراض شاکی خصوصی به قلت مجازات و موجه بودن این اعتراض ضمن تشدید مجازات و تبدیل جزای نقدی مذکور به تحمل چهار ماه حبس در مورد آقای م. ک. رأی صادره نتیجتا تأیید می\\u200cشود. چون دادگاه بدوی در قسمت اخیر ماده ۴ که ذکر شد اظهارنظری ننموده، با توجه به موجود بودن عین مال مطابق آنچه در این ماده ذکر شده به نفع شاکیه از آن استیفاء خواهد شد. رأی صادره نسبت به دو نفر تجدیدنظرخواه قطعی است.. \\nمستشاران دادگاه شعبه ۴۱ تجدیدنظر استان تهران. \\nرفعت قاسمی\\n. \\n. \\n[end]', 'title': 'انتقال ملک توسط مدیون بعد از حکم قطعی مبنی بر تحویل ملک یا تنظیم سند'}]\n"
